        <p>
          Google collects data you input into /code, such as your prompts,
          datasets, and code, as well as generated output, code execution
          results, related usage information, and your feedback. Google uses
          this data, consistent with our{" "}

          such as Google Cloud.

        <p>
          To help with quality and improve our products (such as generative
          machine-learning models that power /code), human reviewers read,
          annotate, and process a sample of /code input and output. We take
          steps to protect your privacy as part of this process. This includes
          disconnecting this data from your Google Account before reviewers see
          or annotate it, and storing those disconnected copies for up to 18
          months. Please do not include sensitive (e.g., confidential) or
          personal information that can be used to identify you or others in
          your prompts or feedback.
